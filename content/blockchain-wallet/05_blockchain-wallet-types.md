#### 5. Blockchain Wallet Types:-

There are two types of blockchain wallets based on private keys: **hot wallets and cold wallets** . Hot wallets are like normal wallets that we carry for day-to-day transactions, and these wallets are user-friendly. Cold wallets are similar to a vault; they store cryptocurrencies with a high level of security.

**1. Hot Wallets and Cold Wallets**:-

Hot wallets are online wallets through which cryptocurrencies can be transferred quickly. They are available online. Examples are Coinbase and Blockchain.info. Cold wallets are digital offline wallets where the transactions are signed offline and then disclosed online. They are not maintained in the cloud on the internet; they are maintained offline to have high security. Examples of cold wallets are Trezor and Ledger.

With hot wallets, private keys are stored in the cloud for faster transfer. With cold wallets, private keys are stored in separate hardware that is not connected to the internet or the cloud, or they are stored on a paper document. Hot wallets are easy to access online 24/7 and can be accessed via a desktop or mobile device, but there is the risk of unrecoverable theft if hacked. With cold wallets, the method of the transaction helps in protecting the wallet from unauthorized access

###### We can further break down wallets into three types:

1. Software wallets.
2. Hardware wallets, which you plug into your USB drive.
3. Typical paper-based wallets, for which you print your public key and private key on a piece of paper and keep it in a secure place.

 #### 1. Software Wallets:-
A software wallet is an application that is downloaded on a device; it could be a desktop or a mobile device, or it could be a web-based wallet that can be accessed online. Breadwallet, XDC ewallet, and  Copay are popular software wallets. We can further categorize software wallets as desktop wallets, online wallets (web wallets), and mobile wallets.

#### 2. Desktop Wallets

 Desktop wallets are cold wallets in which the private keys are stored in cold servers (in your desktop). You can unplug the wallet from the Internet, do some offline transactions, and then bring it back online. In case the main server is lost, then a cold server, basically your desktop, is used as a backup server.

These wallets can be downloaded on any computer but can be accessed only from the system they are installed on, so you make sure the desktop or the machine on which you are downloading the desktop wallet is safe (has a backup and is in a secure location), and that you're maintaining the hardware and not letting the machine go anywhere.
These wallets are definitely cost-efficient. Electrum is one of the most popular desktop wallets.
 
 
#### 3. Online Wallets

These are other kinds of hot wallets that run on the Internet. Users have the benefit of accessing these wallets across any device. It could be a tablet or a desktop, or you can access it from your mobile browser. The private keys are stored online and are managed by a third party. For example, GreenAddress is a Bitcoin wallet that is available on the web, has an Android app, is available on a desktop, and also is available on iOS.
 
#### 4. Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets are similar to online wallets except that they are built only for mobile phone use and accessibility. These wallets have a user-friendly interface that helps you do transactions easily. Mycelium is the best available mobile wallet.
