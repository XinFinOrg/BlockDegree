* To exchange cryptocurrency, the sender needs to sign the transaction with his private key and needs the public key of the receiver.
* There is no physical transfer of assets. Only ownership of cryptos get transferred from sender to the receiver upon transaction success.
* If you anyhow lost access to your wallet account, you can do so by using the seed phrase. It will help you retrieve your account.
* Not all wallets support all kinds of cryptocurrencies.
* Never share your private key with anyone. Doing so will result in losing all your funds.
