#### 3. How Do Blockchain Wallets Work?


First, let's discuss what private and public keys are and how these keys are related to a blockchain wallet. Whenever you create a blockchain wallet, you are provided a private key and a public key that is associated with your wallet. Let's use email as an example. If you want to receive an email from someone, you give him or her your email address.

But giving out your email address doesn't mean someone will be able to send out emails via your account. Someone would have to know your email account's password to do that. Blockchain wallets follow a similar process using a public key and a private key together. A public key is similar to your email address; you can give it to anyone. When your wallet is generated, a public key is generated, and you can share the public key with anyone in order to receive funds.

The private key is top secret. It's similar to your password; it should not get hacked and you should not disclose it to anyone. You use this private key to spend your funds. If someone gets access to your private key, there is a high possibility that your account is compromised, and you might end up losing all the cryptocurrency deposits in your account.
