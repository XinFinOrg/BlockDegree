#### 7. How to protect your private keys?

Cryptography is a means of encoding and decoding information and that is done with the help of keys. A key pair is used to encrypt and decrypt a message.

The keys are actually a string of numbers that point to an address/wallet.

When you are ready to transfer tokens, you do so by giving your public key to the other party. When you are initialising the transaction, you could do so with the help of your private key only. One who has private key has access to the funds. If this is lost or someone else knows it, then you lose access to your funds.

so, it becomes very important to protect your private keys.

* One of the best manner to keep your private keys secure is by generating and printing a paper wallet. This will also promote no cyber attacks. But in this case, you need to store that paper wallet properly in a safe case/box. If it is lost, your access to your funds is lost forever.

* Never rely on third parties. If you are investing into cryptos with some intermediaries involved who are actually trading cryptos on your behalf also, then there are chances for loss of funds. If that person loses access to keys via cyber attack, or death or anything else, you can't claim your right over the funds as they are not physical assets.

* Another manner of storing private keys is on your phones and computers. This is convenient but involves risk also. Since these devices are connected to the internet, they are vulnerable to cyber attacks like phishing scams, viruses and other malware.

* The best method to store private keys safely could be using offline storage devices. Such devices are never connected to the internet, however you can interact with it wirelessly through the companion app. Examples of such devices include Trezor hardware wallet, Ledger Nano S, The Secure Wallet, etc.

####Apart from these methods, few important things are to be taken care of:
* Don't reveal your private keys to anyone, I mean no one irrespective of whoever he/she is.
* Never log in from  someone else's phone.
* Also keep your phone password protected.
* You can store your private key in a password protected file.



### Various methods hacker try to get private key

**Phishing** : 

This is a fake email masquerading as legitimate. Hackers create phishing emails which appear to have come from a well-known person or organisation with the intention to steal some confidential information like your bank account details, aadhaar details, etc. These mails create situations of urgency and panic so that people fall in their trap and end up revealing their information. These mails may contain links to websites which may look similar to that of any known organisation and you input all your details thinking of that organisation. But instead the information would go directly to the hacker's server.
Such mails may also have attachments which when downloaded would install a malware in your system which gives the hacker complete access of your device.

**Malware:** 

These are malicious software written with the intent of compromising a system and stealing all available data. These malwares secretly track the victim's activities, steal, delete and modify the system's data. You could prevent this by frequently updating your operating system, not downloading fake or pirated softwares. Also never click on fake antivirus pop-ups generated on websites.

**Malicious mobile apps:** 

Don't be of the belief that every application available on Google PlayStore or Apple Store is safe and legitimate. Not all the apps are safe. Some could take your privacy to risk if they have been coded with a malicious intent. These apps may ask for unnecessary permissions. With this they can get access to SMS, microphone(record calls), access to camera, admin access and contacts.
So, you should not trust any third party apps. Also, think before downloading. Read reviews and permissions required before downloading.

**Smishing:** 

This is a form of phishing attack in which someone tries to trick you into giving your private information via a phone call or SMS message. It's been very common today. Never believe in them. They will try to trick you with amazing offers and all, but don't fall in their words and reveal the information. 

**Physical security threats:**

 Who knows what is going in the mind of the people you just met or already know. If that person began appearing very close to you but has some malicious intent, you may not be aware of his intention. Here, it could be you only who would give him direct access to your phone, system and so, your privacy is lost and he now has control over your information.

Once the hackers get access to your device, they will get all the data including the keys. And once the keys are known to them, your funds are no more yours.

Your security is in your hands. Never panic if you think you are facing any of these. Take some time to think because in the hurry and panic these attacks create, you may fall into their trap.
