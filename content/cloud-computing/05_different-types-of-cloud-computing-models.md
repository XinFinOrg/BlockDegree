## Different Types of Cloud Computing Models:-

- There are four main cloud computing deployment options: private, public,  hybrid clouds and multi clouds, Each has its own advantages and disadvantages and which one you (or your business) choose will depend on your data as well as the level of security and management you need.

### 1. Public:-
    - A public cloud is probably the most commonly understood cloud computing option. This is where all the services and supporting infrastructure are managed off-site over the Internet and shared across multiple users (or tenants).

  - A good example of a public cloud at the individual consumer level is a streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. Users subscribe to the service through an individual account but access the same services across the platform through the Internet.
  - The advantage of using a public cloud is the increased efficiency and subsequent cost-effectiveness from shared resources. Public clouds are typically cheaper than private and hybrid cloud solutions (as well as traditional on-premise computing) because they rely on economies of scale. Users don't have to pay for services they aren't using and dont have to worry about managing and maintaining the physical infrastructure.
  
### 2. Private:-
  
     - A private cloud provides IT services through the Internet or a private network to select users, rather than to the general public. Instead of having multiple tenants, like a public cloud does, a private cloud typically has only one tenant. All the data is protected behind a firewall. This is a popular choice for many businesses who want the agility of the cloud with greater customization and security.
  
- Private clouds can reside on-site or off-site. The distinguishing feature is the single, private tenant who maintains greater control over the IT services. Private clouds are popular choices for organizations who have high priorities on security and compliance.

### 3. Hybrid:-

     Hybrid cloud environments combine both private and public cloud elements to varying degrees. Despite operating independently, the clouds in a hybrid environment communicate over an encrypted connection and allow for the portability of data and applications. This is an increasingly popular cloud solution because it allows organizations greater flexibility to meet their IT needs.

### 4. Multi Cloud:-

    Multi-cloud is the use of two or more cloud computing services from any number of different cloud vendors. A multi-cloud environment could be all-private, all-public or a combination of both. Companies use multi-cloud environments to distribute computing resources and minimize the risk of downtime and data loss. Often, multi-cloud is confused with the hybrid cloud.
