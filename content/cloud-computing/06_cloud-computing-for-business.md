  <strong>Mobile Access:</strong> Companies offer remote access to data through mobile devices, letting customers access and sync data globally.

  <strong>Data Transfer: </strong> Cloud computing facilitates the transfer and storage of data, making sharing files through PCs or mobiles easy and time-efficient.

  <strong>Services: </strong> Cloud computing includes three main services: Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS). These services help businesses grow by providing software, infrastructure, and platforms over the internet.

  <strong>Development and Testing: </strong> Cloud computing is used for development and testing, offering a cost-effective solution with both physical and virtual resources.

  <strong>Scalable Resources: </strong> Cloud computing allows businesses to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand, avoiding the cost of unused physical servers and ensuring adaptability to changing needs.
