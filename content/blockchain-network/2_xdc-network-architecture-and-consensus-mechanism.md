# XDC Network Architecture:


The XDC Network is a hybrid blockchain platform designed for enterprise applications. It features both public and private chains, with XDC as its native cryptocurrency. Smart contracts are supported, and it emphasises data security and transparency, making it adaptable to a wide range of enterprise use cases.


# Consensus Mechanism (XDPoS):


The XDC Network uses XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS) as its consensus mechanism. XDPoS involves a group of delegates who validate transactions and create new blocks. These delegates are elected based on community voting. The mechanism prioritises scalability, speed, and efficiency, while maintaining security and decentralisation.

## Hybrid Blockchain: Public and Private Components


- **Hybrid Blockchain**:-


The fourth type of Blockchain is Hybrid Blockchain, the blockchain which combines the best of both private and public blockchains. Simply put, a hybrid blockchain provides controlled access (private) and freedom (public) simultaneously. In other words, the hybrid blockchain lets organizations set up a private, permission-based system alongside a public permissionless system.


**With such a system, organizations can control -**


- who can access what data on the blockchain,
- what data can be opened up publicly,
- what data needs to be kept confidential on the private network?


**Fusing different features from private and public blockchains ensures that an organization can work with its stakeholders in the best possible way.**


- Like a consortium blockchain, a hybrid blockchain has the privacy benefits of a permissioned blockchain.
But, unlike a consortium blockchain with multiple participants collectively helping to maintain the network, a hybrid blockchain can have a single entity network administrator.

- Hybrid Blockchain has features of both public and private blockchains


- A transaction in a private network of a hybrid blockchain is usually verified within that network. But users can also release it in the public blockchain to get it verified. Even though transactions and records in a hybrid blockchain are kept private and not made public, they are always open for verifiability on the public blockchain whenever required.


- In the hybrid blockchain, there are two different types of users/nodes based on the level of information that they access:


- **(i)** The first type of users/nodes are those who are part of the private blockchain and have all the control over the blockchain and can decide the level of security permissions for a particular user.


- **(ii)** And the other type of users/nodes are those who are part of the public blockchain and can just access the data released on the blockchain.


* Even though a set of individuals control the hybrid blockchain network, they cannot change the transactions’ immutability and security. They can only control which transactions are made public and which are not.

- ### How can a user join the private network of a hybrid blockchain?


**(i)** A user is required to get permission to join the hybrid blockchain network and become a node on the private network. Once he joins the network, he can fully participate in the blockchain’s activities, like the rights to do transactions, view them, or even append or modify them.


**(ii)** The identity of the user is kept secret from other participating users to protect that user’s privacy. His identity is only revealed to the party/user he is dealing with.


**(iii)** To ensure that the identification process of a user is done correctly, companies and organizations carry out KYC (Know Your Customer) to make it work. Financial institutes, especially, need to handle the KYC process correctly as they cannot allow the transaction to be carried out by a user who is anonymous or not entirely known to the blockchain. Thus the hybrid blockchain has limited anonymity for the users who take part in the network, though public anonymity is still maintained. This leads to an intersection of both the public and private systems.


* ### Advantages of Hybrid Blockchain:


**(i)** The hybrid network offers all the critical features of a public blockchain, such as security, transparency, immutability, and decentralization, but also restricts the ability to access transactions, view, or change transactions like in a private blockchain. Moreover, not everyone can use the network, ensuring that confidential information doesn’t go out of the network. Thus, a hybrid blockchain provides security and privacy but allows communication with third parties.


**(ii)** Since a hybrid blockchain provides the ability to work in a closed ecosystem, thus, organizations don’t have to worry about getting their information leaked or hacked.


**(iii)** Another benefit of using a hybrid blockchain is the low transaction cost as it requires few nodes to verify the transactions. Therefore it also takes less time for the network to reach a consensus.


## XDC Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Consensus




- XDPoS presents an innovative solution to address the scalability challenges in the Ethereum blockchain and similar blockchain platforms. It employs a 108-Masternode system with XDPoS consensus, ensuring rapid transaction confirmations in just 2 seconds.


- Furthermore, XDPOS utilizes cutting-edge methods such as staking through smart contracts, genuine randomization, and double validation to ensure a stable, secure, and definitive blockchain experience.


- Notably, XinFin's XDPoS system seamlessly integrates with EVM-compatible (Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible) protocols, smart contracts, and facilitates cross-chain token transfers, enhancing its interoperability.




## Consensus Mechanism:-


- ### The History of DPoS
Tracing the origins of the PoS consensus mechanism takes us back to the early days of cryptocurrency development. In 2012, Peercoin debuted as the first functioning implementation of the PoS mechanism. Fast forward to 2013, Daniel Larimer conceived the idea of DPoS, and subsequently, in 2014, DPoS was introduced as a modified version of the standard PoS algorithm. Then, the first iteration of Delegated Proof-of-Stake, BitShares, launched in 2015.


[XDPos](https://xdc.network) is amongst the fastest, most efficient, decentralized, and flexible consensus model in use today. XDPoS leverages the power of stakeholders to resolve consensus issues fairly and democratically, and since nominators must satisfy self-KYC requirements, XDPoS is more enterprise-ready and regulatory-compliant than other blockchains.


- ### Definitions
**XDPoS (XDC Delegated Proof of Stake):** A consensus mechanism designed to select network validators by having coin holders delegate their votes.


**Validator (usually denoted L):** A node on the network responsible for producing and validating blocks.


**Nominator:** A coin holder who stakes or delegates their coins to one or more validators.


**Epoch:** (usually denoted 𝑁): Corresponding to 𝐿∈ℕ blocks, the time required for a specific number of blocks to get finalized on the chain.


## Voting


### Staking
- Users can stake their coins by sending them to the staking contract.


- The staked amount must be greater than a predetermined minimum (MIN_STAKE).


- After staking, users will have to wait for two epochs (epoch N+2) to be eligible to vote for a validator.


### Delegating
- After staking and waiting two epochs, a nominator can vote for a validator.


- The vote will be effective in epoch N+2, where N is the current epoch.


- New votes can only be cast once every two epochs.


- A single nominator can only vote for a single validator. If users want to delegate to multiple validators, they must divide up their coins among several accounts, registering individually as nominators.


### Withdrawing
- Nominators can withdraw their staked coins.


- To do so, they must rescind their vote.


- After waiting a certain number of epochs (WITHDRAWAL_PERIOD), the staked coins will be unlocked, and the smart contract will return them to the nominator's wallet.

## XDC Network Nodes and Governance


- explores the role of nodes in the XDC Network and how decentralized governance mechanisms enable decision-making and network upgrades. Learn how nodes validate transactions and how token holders influence the blockchain's evolution through voting and proposals.




- XDC Network, also known as XinFin Network, is a blockchain platform designed for enterprise use cases, offering features such as smart contracts and hybrid architecture. Nodes and governance are essential components of any blockchain network, including XDC Network. Let's break down these concepts with a real-time example:


### Nodes:
- Nodes are the computers or servers that participate in the XDC Network. There are different types of nodes in the network, including:


### Masternodes:


- These are special nodes responsible for processing and validating transactions. Masternodes typically require a certain amount of XDC tokens to be staked as collateral, ensuring their commitment to the network's security and governance.


### Validator Nodes:
- These nodes also validate transactions and maintain the network's security. They are essential for reaching consensus on the blockchain.


### Full Nodes:
These nodes store a complete copy of the XDC blockchain and help distribute information across the network.


In a real-time example, consider a company that wants to use the XDC Network for its supply chain management. The company sets up one or more nodes to connect to the XDC Network. These nodes will help validate and record transactions related to the movement of goods within their supply chain.


## Governance:


- XDC 2.0 aims to streamline the governance process by implementing efficient voting mechanisms and decision-making protocols. This enables token holders to actively participate in network governance, contributing to important decisions and protocol upgrades. The enhanced governance mechanism promotes a more decentralized and inclusive approach to decision-making, ensuring that the interests of the XDC community are represented and enabling the network to adapt and evolve over time in a transparent and efficient manner.

- Governance in the XDC Network refers to the mechanisms and processes by which decisions are made regarding network upgrades, changes to protocol rules, and the allocation of resources. The XDC Network uses a decentralized governance model, often involving its token holders in decision-making.


In practice, governance might work as follows:


- **Proposal:** Any network participant, including the company from the previous example, can make a proposal for a network upgrade or change. For instance, they might propose adding a specific feature to the XDC blockchain to improve supply chain tracking.


- **Voting:** XDC token holders, which can include the company and other participants, will be allowed to vote on the proposal. The number of tokens they hold may determine the weight of their votes. In some cases, masternode operators might have more significant influence due to their collateral stakes.


- **Implementation:** If the proposal passes a certain threshold of approval, it can be implemented in the network's software by developers.


- **Execution:** The proposal becomes part of the XDC Network's rules, affecting how transactions, like supply chain data, are processed.


the company could participate in the governance of the XDC Network by voting on proposals that align with its supply chain needs, influencing the direction of the network.


XDC Network nodes and governance are integral to the operation and evolution of the blockchain platform. Real-time examples, such as a company using the network for supply chain management, illustrate how nodes process transactions and how governance decisions impact the network's functionality and features.
